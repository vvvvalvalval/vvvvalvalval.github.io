    <p>I recently worked on a project which consisted of merging related data exports from a variety of sources and extracting  accounting information from them. Because the problem was inherently very relational, I was naturally led to use an SQL  database in the project (in this case PostgreSQL).</p><p>I ended up expressing much more of the business logic than I thought using pure SQL - more precisely, <i>temporary SQL Views</i> -  so I thought I'd share my findings here.</p><h2 id="why&#95;sql?">Why SQL?</h2><p>A lot of programmers think of SQL merely as a protocol for interacting with data storage, and prefer to express  domain logic in a general-purpose language (JavaScript, Ruby, C#, ...). It's a shame, because SQL is actually very expressive!  When applied to business logic, SQL can make for programs that are not only more concise and readable, but also more <strong>declarative</strong>  (that is, programs that express only their intent, not how to achieve it) which is a very effective way of eliminating  <a href='https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/blob/master/design/out-of-the-tar-pit.pdf'>accidental complexity</a> from your code.</p><p>More concretely, I believe the advantages of SQL come from:</p><ul><li>relations being <strong>more powerful data abstractions</strong> than the ones available in general-purpose languages (arrays, structs, maps, lists, objects etc.)</li><li>the fact that the data is centralized and <i>at hand</i> eliminates many difficult concerns associated with moving data (encoding and packaging the data, validation, distributed systems issues etc.)</li></ul><p>Modern SQL engines such as <a href='https://www.postgresql.org/'>PostgreSQL</a> also offer several practical benefits:</p><ul><li>they provide an <strong>interactive</strong> programming environment</li><li>they come with an expressive, yet relatively flexible <strong>static type system</strong></li><li>they achieve quite good <strong>performance</strong> for the level of abstraction for which you typically use them</li></ul><p>Finally, SQL is very <strong>portable</strong>. SQL is much more universally known that JavaScript / Ruby / C# / etc., which means SQL  code is more accessible and reusable. Fun fact: this was quite useful for the data processing project I mentioned. For  reasons inherent to the company, it had to be shipped in PHP, but since PHP makes for a poor experimental environment for  data manipulation, I did the 'exploratory' phase of the project in Clojure then migrated it to PHP. Because most of the advanced  logic was expressed in SQL, I was able to do the migration without too much effort, while having explored the domain with  a fast feedback loop.</p><h2 id="why&#95;sql&#95;views?">Why SQL views?</h2><p><a href='https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-createview.html'>SQL views</a> are the primary mechanism for abstraction in SQL, playing a similar  role to functions in procedural languages, or methods in class-based languages:</p><ul><li>they factor our repetition, by replacing an SQL expression with a name</li><li>they hide implementation details: code that calls a view only knows the shape of the data, not how it is computed</li><li>they provide a level of indirection between how data is stored and how it is queried</li></ul><p>So SQL views are quite effective; however, the fact that they're stored durably by default brings several operational problems.  This is where <strong>temporary views</strong> come in, as we'll see in the next section.</p><h3 id="example:&#95;e-commerce&#95;cash&#95;flow">Example: e-commerce cash flow</h3><p>As an example, imagine you have to compute the cash flow of an e-commerce company. Here are the business requirements:</p><ul><li>The company receives money via Orders: each Order consists of several Line Items, each Line Item being a certain quantity of a Product</li><li>The company spends money via Purchases</li><li>The cash flow consists of the Cash Movements corresponding to Orders and Purchases</li></ul><p>This can be expressed with the following SQL:</p><pre><code class="sql">CREATE VIEW orders&#95;cash&#95;movements AS &#40;
  SELECT
    order&#95;id,
    order&#95;time AS cash&#95;movement&#95;time,
    SUM&#40;li&#95;amount&#41; AS cash&#95;movement&#95;amount
  FROM &#40;
    SELECT
      o.order&#95;id,
      o.order&#95;time,
      &#40;li.line&#95;item&#95;quantity &#42; p.product&#95;price&#41; AS li&#95;amount
    FROM orders o
    JOIN line&#95;items li ON li.order&#95;id = o.order&#95;id
    JOIN products p ON li.product&#95;id = p.product&#95;id
  &#41; AS li
  GROUP BY order&#95;id, order&#95;time
&#41;;

CREATE VIEW purchases&#95;cash&#95;movements AS &#40;
  SELECT
    purchase&#95;id,
    purchase&#95;time AS cash&#95;movement&#95;time,
    &#40;-1 &#42; purchase&#95;amount&#41; AS cash&#95;movement&#95;amount
  FROM purchases
&#41;;

CREATE VIEW cash&#95;movements AS &#40;
  SELECT cash&#95;movement&#95;time, cash&#95;movement&#95;amount FROM orders&#95;cash&#95;movements
  UNION ALL
  SELECT cash&#95;movement&#95;time, cash&#95;movement&#95;amount FROM purchases&#95;cash&#95;movements
&#41;;

</code></pre><h2 id="why&#95;temporary&#95;views?">Why temporary views?</h2><h3 id="durable&#95;information,&#95;ephemeral&#95;logic">Durable information, ephemeral logic</h3><p>Let's go back to the basics: an <i>information system</i> consists of:</p><ul><li><strong>information</strong></li><li><strong>business logic</strong> processing this information</li></ul><p>We usually want information to be <strong>stored durably</strong>, because we don't want to lose any of it.</p><p>On the other hand, we typically <strong>don't want to commit durably to our business logic</strong>; we want to be able to change our minds  about how our business logic handles information (because we made a bug, because business requirements changed, etc.)</p><p>This is why information systems are traditionally made of a durable database storing raw information, and processes executing  business-logic code in an ephemeral way (usually written in languages such as JavaScript / C# / Ruby / etc.)</p><h3 id="the&#95;problem&#95;with&#95;stored&#95;sql&#95;views">The problem with stored SQL views</h3><p>The problem with ordinary SQL views is that they don't have this 'ephemeral' property: if you want to change the logic of  an SQL view, you have to make a database migration, which will affect all the database clients at the same time, making it  difficult to manage operationally. For many applications, this operational overhead is a deal breaker for using SQL views.</p><h3 id="temporary&#95;views&#95;to&#95;the&#95;rescue!">TEMPORARY views to the rescue!</h3><p>This is why <a href='https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-createview.html'><strong>temporary</strong> SQL views</a> are useful.  A temporary SQL view is scoped to an SQL session, which means that both its visibility and its lifecycle will be limited  to a single database client.</p><h3 id="how&#95;do&#95;you&#95;use&#95;temporary&#95;views?">How do you use temporary views?</h3><p>You define a temporary view in SQL code by adding the TEMPORARY keyword to the CREATE VIEW command.  Continuing with our cash flow example:</p><pre><code class="sql">CREATE TEMPORARY VIEW orders&#95;cash&#95;movements AS &#40;
  -- &#91;...&#93;
&#41;;

CREATE TEMPORARY VIEW purchases&#95;cash&#95;movements AS &#40;
  -- &#91;...&#93;
&#41;;

CREATE TEMPORARY VIEW cash&#95;movements AS &#40;
  -- &#91;...&#93;
&#41;;
</code></pre><p>These <code>CREATE TEMPORARY VIEW</code> commands should be executed once each time a database connection is created.  Modern SQL connection pooling libraries can be configured to execute an SQL statement each time a connection is created;  for instance, for the <a href='https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP'>HikariCP</a> library,  this is the done via the <code>connectionInitSql</code> option.</p><h3 id="caching&#95;without&#95;materialized&#95;views">Caching without Materialized Views</h3><p>A popular strategy for caching with PostgreSQL is to use <a href='https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/rules-materializedviews.html'>Materialized Views</a>.  For instance, we could use a Materialized View to cache our cash flow computation example:</p><pre><code class="sql">-- WON'T WORK

-- defining the materialized view
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW cash&#95;flow&#95;cache&#95;v0 AS &#40;
  SELECT &#42; FROM cash&#95;movements;
&#41;;

-- &#91;...&#93;

-- refreshing the materialized view
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW cash&#95;flow&#95;cache&#95;v0;
</code></pre><p>This won't work, because a PostgreSQL Materialized View is a durable object, whereas a Temporary View is a temporary object;  therefore, a Materialized View cannot depend on a Temporary View.</p><p>One way to circumvent this limitation is to define only the schema for the cache table, and let the client refresh the caching  table with a plain old query:</p><pre><code class="sql">-- defining the cache table
CREATE TABLE cash&#95;flow&#95;cache&#95;v0 &#40;
  cash&#95;movement&#95;time TIMESTAMP,
  cash&#95;movement&#95;amount INTEGER
&#41;;

-- &#91;...&#93;

-- refreshing the cache table
-- &#40;preferrable to do this in a transaction&#41;

TRUNCATE TABLE cash&#95;flow&#95;cache&#95;v0;
INSERT INTO cash&#95;flow&#95;cache&#95;v0 &#40;cash&#95;movement&#95;time, cash&#95;movement&#95;amount&#41;
  SELECT cash&#95;movement&#95;time, cash&#95;movement&#95;amount FROM cash&#95;movements;
</code></pre><p>This has the advantage of minimizing the amount of business logic that we need to put in our stored caching code.</p><h2 id="what's&#95;missing:&#95;'parameterized'&#95;temporary&#95;views">What's missing: 'parameterized' temporary views</h2><p>One thing I've found to be lacking in SQL is the ability to define views that are parameterized with other values -  in particular, parameterized with other relations.</p><p>For instance, going back to our cash flow example, imagine we want to compute the following aggregations:</p><ul><li>revenue per day</li><li>expenses per day</li><li>total cash flow per day</li></ul><pre><code>CREATE TEMPORARY VIEW revenue&#95;per&#95;day AS &#40;
  SELECT day, SUM&#40;cash&#95;movement&#95;amount&#41; AS amount
  FROM &#40;
    SELECT
      date&#95;trunc&#40;cash&#95;movement&#95;time, 'day'&#41; AS day,
      cash&#95;movement&#95;amount
    FROM cash&#95;movements
    WHERE cash&#95;movement&#95;amount &gt; 0
  &#41; AS x
  GROUP BY day
&#41;;

CREATE TEMPORARY VIEW expenses&#95;per&#95;day AS &#40;
  SELECT day, SUM&#40;cash&#95;movement&#95;amount&#41; AS amount
  FROM &#40;
    SELECT
      date&#95;trunc&#40;cash&#95;movement&#95;time, 'day'&#41; AS day,
      cash&#95;movement&#95;amount
    FROM cash&#95;movements
    WHERE cash&#95;movement&#95;amount &lt; 0
  &#41; AS x
  GROUP BY day
&#41;;

CREATE TEMPORARY VIEW cash&#95;flow&#95;per&#95;day AS &#40;
  SELECT day, SUM&#40;cash&#95;movement&#95;amount&#41; AS amount
  FROM &#40;
    SELECT
      date&#95;trunc&#40;cash&#95;movement&#95;time, 'day'&#41; AS day,
      cash&#95;movement&#95;amount
    FROM cash&#95;movements
  &#41; AS x
  GROUP BY day
&#41;;
</code></pre><p>That's a lot of code duplication! I wish I could do something like the following instead:</p><pre><code class="sql">CREATE TEMPORARY VIEW aggregate&#95;cash&#95;flow&#95;by&#95;day &#40;cash&#95;movmts&#41; -- mind the parameter here
AS &#40;
  SELECT day, SUM&#40;cash&#95;movement&#95;amount&#41; AS amount
  FROM &#40;
    SELECT
      date&#95;trunc&#40;cash&#95;movement&#95;time, 'day'&#41; AS day,
      cash&#95;movement&#95;amount
    FROM cash&#95;movmts
  &#41; AS x
  GROUP BY day
&#41;;

CREATE TEMPORARY VIEW revenue&#95;per&#95;day AS &#40;
  SELECT &#42; FROM aggregate&#95;cash&#95;flow&#95;by&#95;day&#40;
    SELECT &#42; FROM cash&#95;movements
    WHERE cash&#95;movement&#95;amount &gt; 0
  &#41;
&#41;;

CREATE TEMPORARY VIEW expenses&#95;per&#95;day AS &#40;
  SELECT &#42; FROM aggregate&#95;cash&#95;flow&#95;by&#95;day&#40;
    SELECT &#42; FROM cash&#95;movements
    WHERE cash&#95;movement&#95;amount &lt; 0
  &#41;
&#41;;

CREATE TEMPORARY VIEW cash&#95;flow&#95;per&#95;day AS &#40;
  SELECT &#42; FROM aggregate&#95;cash&#95;flow&#95;by&#95;day&#40;
    SELECT &#42; FROM cash&#95;movements
  &#41;
&#41;;
</code></pre><p>Going back to our SQL views / functions / methods analogy: in their current form, SQL views give us the equivalent of  0-arguments functions, or static methods. I wish we could have the equivalent of functions with arbitrary arity!  This would give us much more leverage for code reuse and decoupling.</p><p>Note that stored procedures can't really help us achieve this, as they are not temporary. The best way to emulate them currently  is probably to use a client SQL-generating library.</p><h2 id="summary">Summary</h2><p>I have found that:</p><ul><li>SQL is very powerful for expressing domain logic: consider using it for other purposes than just shipping data to/from storage!</li><li>SQL views are useful for code reuse and abstraction, but because they store business logic globally and durably, they create operational difficulties</li><li>PostgreSQL TEMPORARY views eliminate most of these operational difficulties</li><li>If SQL views could be parameterized, they would get insanely more powerful.</li></ul><p>Please feel free to challenge these assertions in comments!</p>
